## 5. Conclusion
At the conclusion of Section 2, two proportions were SOFA-Biometrics:  one for zero information attacks and another for targeted attacks. Section 4 included discussion on determining the PAD error rate by testing a suite of materials associated with the expected attack potential of an application.  This has implications for the basis of the effort computation:  effort should also be computed per material tested.  These values of effort and PAD error should be used to compute SOFA-Biometrics scores to determine the minimum strength.  Following the “weakest link” theory, the minimum SOFA score shall be used to characterize the strength of the authenticator.

NIST continues to research and develop the proposed SOFA equation to better understand the inherent strength of authentication systems. A number of opportunities exist for further study beyond this document, especially for the factors identified within this paper. Better defining Effort, dependencies between FMR and PADER, and determining the appropriate testing methodologies and representative types of artifacts for the two measures are only a few of the opportunities for expansion. Once measures for inherent strength in biometrics mature appropriately, methods for comparing biometric systems against other authentication systems using the same type of quantitative measures will be the next focus for NIST efforts.

Feedback is welcomed and highly encouraged as NIST continues this effort. This document will be iteratively reviewed and updated based on community feedback. That feedback will be instrumental for determining the appropriate venue for additional work in the future. Comments can be sent to sofa@nist.gov or GitHub during the public comment periods.
